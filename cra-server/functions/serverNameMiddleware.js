/**
 * This middleware method takes off the first segment which is the serverName an puts it into a query parameter
 * I did consider using Regex match and replace along these lines 'const matchCriteria = /^\/([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]+)\//;'
 * but decided not to in case the characters I was tolerating was not enough. Note the split slice join is not not very performant
 * due to the creation of array elements.
 *
 * For urls that start with servers - these are rest calls that need to be passed through to the back end.
 * URLs before and after
 *   /   => /
 *   /servers/aaa => /servers/aaa
 *   /servers/aaa/bbb => /servers/aaa/bbb
 *   /coco1/ => /?servername=coco1
 *   /coco1/abc => /abc?servername=coco1
 *   /coco1/abc/de => /abc/de?servername=coco1
 *   /display.ico => /display.ico
 *
 * This middleware also validates that the server name that has been supplied is valid (i.e. is defined in our list of servers).
 * So we can have a better user experience, the login screen is displayed for /<server name> and /<server name>/login even if the <server name>
 * is invalid. The request will fail on the login post if the <server name> is not known.
